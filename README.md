# 8 bit ALU using Verilog HDL

This repository contains the Verilog implementation of an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). The ALU performs eight different operations based on a 3-bit opcode input, including basic arithmetic, logical, and shift operations. The design is suitable for FPGA implementation and includes support for handling overflow through a carry-out signal.

Operations:
000 - Addition
001 - Subtraction
010 - Multiplication
011 - Left Shift
100 - Right Shift
101 - Logical AND
110 - Logical OR
111 - Logical XOR
